    Juubidara is a series of different forms that the second-to-last final antagonist, Madara Uchiha, obtains after absorbing the Ten Tails, also known as the Juubi. During these transformations, he gains the powers of Limbo, insanely fast regeneration, Six Paths Senjutsu, Truthseeking Orbs, and the Rinne-Sharingan Obito Uchiha, when using the power of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path (DMS), reaches an incredibly high level of strength and abilities. Here are the key aspects of his full power:

    1. Rinnegan: With the Rinnegan, Obito gains access to powerful techniques such as the Six Paths of Pain, which allows him to control six corpses as if they were his own body, each with unique abilities.
    
    2. Sharingan: Obito's Mangekyō Sharingan grants him access to Kamui, a powerful space-time ninjutsu that allows him to become intangible and teleport himself or objects to another dimension.
    
    3. Ten-Tails Jinchuriki: At his peak, Obito becomes the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails, which exponentially boosts his chakra reserves and physical abilities. This form grants him near-immortality, immense strength, speed, and the ability to use Truth-Seeking Balls, which can nullify ninjutsu and are highly destructive.
    
    4. Gudōdama (Truth-Seeking Balls): These orbs can change shape and size, act as offensive and defensive tools, and are made of all five nature transformations plus Yin-Yang Release, making them nearly indestructible.
    
    5. Immense Chakra and Vitality: As the Ten-Tails Jinchuriki, Obito's chakra levels are massive, allowing him to sustain powerful techniques for extended periods.
    
    6. Regenerative Abilities: The Ten-Tails provides him with rapid healing and regeneration, making him extremely difficult to injure or kill.
    
    7. Enhanced Physical Abilities: His strength, speed, and durability are significantly enhanced, making him a formidable opponent in both close and long-range combat.
    
    8. Six Paths Senjutsu: As a Jinchuriki, he gains access to this powerful form of sage power, enhancing his abilities even further.
    
    Obito at his full power is one of the most formidable antagonists in the "Naruto" series, rivaling the strongest characters in the Naruto universe </p>
